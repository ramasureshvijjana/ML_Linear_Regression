# Linear Regression

    1. In this project, we will learn How the linear regression model used as a real-time ML project.
    2. It has end to end procedure of ML project.
    3. This total project divided into 4 parts.

## Project different parts

    1. Understanding Data
    2. Label Encoding
    3. Feature Scaling
    4. Model creating, training, testing

### Data

   In the Data folder we can observe 3 CSV files:
    
   1. [insurance.csv](https://github.com/ramasureshvijjana/ML_Linear_Regression/blob/master/Data/insurance.csv) is the first file, It is raw data.
   2. [Encoded_Data.csv](https://github.com/ramasureshvijjana/ML_Linear_Regression/blob/master/Data/Encoded_Data.csv) file generated after the label encoding process.
   3. [Scaled_Data.csv](https://github.com/ramasureshvijjana/ML_Linear_Regression/blob/master/Data/Scaled_Data.csv)  file generated after the feature scaling process.
